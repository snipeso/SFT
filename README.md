# Speech Fluency Test (SFT)

## Design

- Script presents 10 sentences, all at once.
- Participant, when ready, presses enter, recorder kicks in, a timer bar shrinks, they have to repeat sentence as many times as possible within 10 seconds

## Scripts

### main

This file dictates what each experiment really does, what it shows when, etc.

### config

This is a folder with multiple configurations, some of which are additions to the main configuration configSession.py, which should be identical for all tasks in the same experiment.

Specifies all the variables. ALL of them! They are saved in a dictionary, approximately grouping things by theme.

### screen

This is a class that takes care of ALL screen related activity, initializing all the visual components, and then providing clean functions for showing different setups

### datalog

This is a class that takes care of saving the data to an output folder, grouped by day. It saves the configuration in its entirety, and a second file that saves a dictionary with anything the main.py file dumps into it.

### trigger

This is a class that takes care of all the technical details of sending triggers.

### scorer

This is optional, it lets you easily keep track of participant performance, so that you can spit out the result in the terminal at the end, or whenver you quit.

## Setup Instructions (Linux)

### Setting up env

Copy local env:

1. Run within current folder: `cp {env} .`
2. Run `pyvenv env`

Make env (recommended into a general projects folder so can use for other experiments):

1. Create in folder `pyvenv psychopyEnv`
2. Activate with `source psychopyEnv/bin/activate`
3. Install requirements: `pip install requirements.txt`

If psychopy has problems, just download all of these:

`sudo apt install python3-dev libx11-dev libasound2-dev portaudio19-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libxi-dev build-essential libgtk-3-dev gtk3.0 python3-wxgtk3.0`

and if you need more:

`sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev libgtk2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libnotify-dev libgstreamerd-3-dev`

Create requirements:

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

### Give account access to ports for triggers (and for shortcuts ?)

1. Add you user to the riht group: `sudo uermod -a -G dialout $USER`
2. Identify the name of the port, and save as "serial_device" in CONF: `ls /dev/tty{USB,ACM}*`, only one should show up.

### Create starting shortcut

This is needed so you can start the experiment from wherever in the terminal.

1. Make sure there is the file exp-sample
2. Run `code ~/.bashrc` in terminal
3. Add at the bottom: `export PATH=~/Projects/sample_psychopy/:$PATH` and save
4. Give permission to use that file: `chmod +x Projects/sample_psychopy/exp-sample`
5. Start a new window to see if it worked

Then from a new terminal, you can run directly `exp-match2sample` and it starts!

### Get monitor settings

#### Linux

1. Run `xrandr` in terminal

### Set up audio

1. (linux) `pip install pyo`
2. launch psychopy GUI, go to preferences, and re-order preffered sound thingies so PYO is first

## How to run

### Linux

From within folder:

1. Enter psychopy environment in terminal, either using shortcut `psyEnv` or `source ~/Projects/psychopyEnv/bin/activate`
2. Then run with `python3 main.py`

From anywhere (needs to setup shortcut first):

1. Configure participant and session: `export participant=P00 session=0`
2. Run specific task: `exp-sample`

### Windows (booo)

1. Open psychopy
2. Open visual studio code (or similar)
   - modify participant ID and session, save
3. Open "main.py" for this experiment
4. Click the green run button

## How to check that everything works

### How to measure reaction time accuracy (just python vs reality)

1. Set the stimulus position to always be 0.0, and the color to be blue, and the ISI (inter stimulus interval) is between 1 and 2
2. on an iphone 6 or later (but better if less than XR), download the app "is it snappy"
3. start recording just before starting the task, such that the key you will press and the screen are both in view
4. play the task at least 20 trials
5. on the app, reveiw the video
   - go frame by frame until you reach the first frame in which the stimulus appears
   - mark this as "input" in the bottom left
   - continue until the first frame in which you visibily see the key being pressed down, mark this as "output"
     the app will calculate the difference in miliseconds. repeat until desired.
6. open the output, identify the corresponding reaction times, subtract, and determine the average difference between filmed RTs and computer recorded RTs

## Credits:

## TODO:

- make a demo version with a seperate set of sentences
- get rid of sounds
